## Important Before You Merge
* __Please `pull` first every time before you want to make some changes by running `git pull` in order to keep your project files up to date__

* __If you want to try something new that you are not sure if it works, you can start a new branch and commit your changes on that branch instead of the master branch.__
  * To create a new branch, run `git branch <YOUR BRANCH NAME>`
  * To switch to the branch, run `git checkout <YOUR BRANCH NAME>`

* __Please fix any conflicts before push to Github__
